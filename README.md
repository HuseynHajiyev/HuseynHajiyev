I am 30 years old, currently living in Baku, Azerbaijan. I studied Business Mangagement BSc, IT Management for Business MSc, and, recently, graduated a bootcamp focused on Ruby on Rails. Decided to change my career to software development and engineering after I became weary of Business Management. After my masters, I continued my coding and took on courses that would help me as a developer and am now a full-time software engineer. Currently, I am working as a part-time IT Business Analyst and a freelance web developer 👨‍💻. 

My recent project is Participle, you can find it here <a href="https://participle-plus.vercel.app/" target="_blank" >Participle➕</a>.
