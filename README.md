Welcome!

I'm Huseyn. I am 29 years old, currently living in Istanbul. I studied Business Mangagement BSc, IT Management for Business MSc, and, recently, graduated a bootcamp focused on Ruby on Rails. Decided to change my career to software development and engineering after I became weary of Business Management. After my masters, I continued my coding and took on courses that would help me as a developer.

My recent project is Participle, you can find it here <a href="[https://participle-plus.vercel.app/]">Participle</a>.
