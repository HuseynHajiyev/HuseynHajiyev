Welcome!

I'm Huseyn. I am 27 years old, currently living in Istanbul. I studied Business Mangagement BSc, IT Management for Business MSc, and, recently, graduated a bootcamp focused on Ruby on Rails.

My recent project is Kanaku, you can find it here <a href="http://www.kanaku.me/">Kanaku</a>.

NOTE: Kanaku is currently only designed for mobile users. 

Rent-A-Car is better suited for desktop viewing. Both apps still in development.
